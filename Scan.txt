RISK ANALYSIS:
Port: 21/tcp (ftp)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: FTP transmits credentials in cleartext. Mitigation: Disable FTP or replace with SFTP/FTPS; restrict access by IP; strong creds.

Port: 22/tcp (ssh)
Risk: Medium
Why / Mitigation: SSH is common remote admin vector — safe if hardened. Mitigation: Use key-based auth, disable password logins, change port or use port-knocking, fail2ban, restrict source IPs.

Port: 23/tcp (telnet)
Risk: Critical
Why / Mitigation: Telnet is unencrypted and easily abused. Mitigation: Disable Telnet; use SSH instead; block on firewall.

Port: 25/tcp (smtp)
Risk: Medium
Why / Mitigation: Mail servers can be abused for spam or exploited. Mitigation: Require auth/relay restrictions, patch MTA, monitor logs, restrict port to known mail gateways.

Port: 53/tcp (domain)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: Open DNS can be used for cache poisoning, DNS amplification. Mitigation: Run authoritative/recursive separation; disable open recursion; rate-limit and restrict queries.

Port: 80/tcp (http)
Risk: Medium
Why / Mitigation: HTTP may expose web apps with vulnerabilities. Mitigation: Use HTTPS, patch web servers, WAF, scan web apps, remove dev/test pages.

Port: 111/tcp (rpcbind)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: rpcbind/portmapper can expose RPC services and lead to remote exploits. Mitigation: Disable if unused; firewall RPC ports; restrict to trusted hosts.

Port: 139/tcp (netbios-ssn)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: SMB/NetBIOS exposes file shares and credentials. Mitigation: Block on WAN, disable NetBIOS over TCP if not needed, enforce SMB signing, patch.

Port: 445/tcp (microsoft-ds)
Risk: Critical
Why / Mitigation: SMB is high-risk (ransomware/remote code exec history). Mitigation: Block from untrusted networks, apply MS patches, limit shares, use strong auth and monitoring.

Port: 512/tcp (exec)
Risk: Critical
Why / Mitigation: rsh/rlogins are insecure and allow remote exec without encryption. Mitigation: Disable rsh/rlogin; use SSH.

Port: 513/tcp (login)
Risk: Critical
Why / Mitigation: Same as above — insecure legacy remote login. Mitigation: Disable; use SSH.

Port: 514/tcp (shell)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: Legacy remote shell services and syslog implications. Mitigation: Disable insecure services; use secure logging and SSH.

Port: 1099/tcp (rmiregistry)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: Java RMI can expose remote objects; often misconfigured and vulnerable. Mitigation: Restrict access, require auth, patch JVM apps, bind to localhost if internal only.

Port: 1524/tcp (ingreslock)
Risk: Medium
Why / Mitigation: Legacy DB or lock services may be unpatched. Mitigation: Remove legacy services, patch, firewall restrict.

Port: 2049/tcp (nfs)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: NFS can expose file systems; by default little auth for v3. Mitigation: Export only to trusted networks, use NFSv4 with auth (sec), firewall.

Port: 2121/tcp (ccproxy-ftp)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: Alternate FTP services same FTP risks. Mitigation: Disable or secure (SFTP/FTPS), restrict access.

Port: 3306/tcp (mysql)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: Databases exposed to network are attractive target. Mitigation: Bind to localhost, use strong DB creds, restrict IPs, use TLS, audit/log.

Port: 5432/tcp (postgresql)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: Same DB concerns as MySQL. Mitigation: Bind to localhost, firewall, strong auth, TLS, role hardening.

Port: 5900/tcp (vnc)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: VNC often lacks strong auth and is unencrypted. Mitigation: Disable or tunnel over SSH/VPN, enforce strong passwords and network restrictions.

Port: 6000/tcp (X11)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: X11 remote display can allow input sniffing and code exec. Mitigation: Block from network, use SSH X11 forwarding instead.

Port: 6667/tcp (irc)
Risk: Medium
Why / Mitigation: IRC servers/clients can be abused or used as C2. Mitigation: Restrict access and monitor traffic.

Port: 8009/tcp (ajp13)
Risk: High
Why / Mitigation: Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) has had severe vulnerabilities (e.g., Ghostcat). Mitigation: Disable AJP if unused; bind to localhost; apply patches; restrict access.

Port: 8180/tcp (unknown)
Risk: Medium
Why / Mitigation: Likely alternate HTTP/tomcat admin UI — can expose admin panels. Mitigation: Verify service, restrict access, enable auth, patch apps.

SCAN RESULTS:
PORT     STATE     SERVICE
80/tcp   open      http
7443/tcp filtered  oracleas-https

RISK ANALYSIS:
Port: 80/tcp (http)
Risk: Medium
Why / Mitigation: HTTP serves content unencrypted — attackers can intercept or tamper with traffic and web apps can expose vulnerabilities. Mitigation: Serve traffic over HTTPS (redirect 80 → 443), patch web server and web apps, remove default pages, use a WAF, harden and monitor logs.

Port: 7443/tcp (oracleas-https)
Risk: Medium
Why / Mitigation: filtered indicates packets are blocked/filtered by a firewall/IPS (not responding). Port 7443 is often used for application-server HTTPS (Oracle/Tomcat). If reachable, it would expose management interfaces or app endpoints. Mitigation: Verify the service (identify banner/version), keep TLS configs and app server patched, restrict access to trusted IPs or VPN, confirm firewall rules intentionally filter/unfilter as required, and monitor attempts.
